These types of file paths are called <b>absolute paths</b>. This file path is valid for most computers that run Windows, but some other Operating Systems may have different folder setups. This is why it is useful to use <b>relative paths</b>. Relative paths do not start from the root directory. Instead, they start from the directory you are currently in. By default, Jupyter Notebooks are stored in <b><code>C:\\Users\\CurrentUser</code></b> (where <b><code>CurrentUser</code></b> is your Windows username). To move into a directory using a relative path, for example, to the desktop folder, you would just write <b><code>.\\Desktop</code></b>.

    "Errors\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Syntax errors\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>\"In computer science, the syntax of a computer language is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured statements or expressions in that language.\"</i><br><br>Therefore, a syntax error is an error that does not obey the rules of the programming language. For example, parenthesis always comes in pairs... so <b><code>(1+2)</code></b> is OK, but <b><code>1+2)</code></b> is not. Below another example of a syntax error.  As you will see — this error is caught by the interpreter before running the code (hence, the <code>print</code> statements do not result in anything being printed).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if I want to raise 2 to the 3rd power applying the wrong syntax, it will cause a syntax error."
