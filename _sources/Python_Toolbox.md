Or you can test it <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-python-calculator/repl/index.html?toolbar=1&kernel=python&code=print(%27You%20may%20begin!%27)" target="_blank">here</a> in a new tab.

You are always welcome to use one of these options to practice with code as you go through the material. When the console is critical for completing the exercises in a certain chapter, a drop-down note will be added that includes a special link inside, just like this:

`````{admonition} Open the Python Calculator for this page
:class: tip, dropdown
Click this <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-python-calculator/repl/index.html?toolbar=1&kernel=python&code=print('You may begin!')" target="_blank">link</a> and wait until the message "<tt>You may begin!</tt>" is printed to start evaluating code. More information about this tool can be found [here](calculator). 

Remember that all pages in this course can also be opened as an interactive notebook via Binder or Colab using the {fa}rocket icon above (read more about it [here](nb-links)).
`````

That's it! The Binder and Colab links are explained in the next section.

```{warning}
A special instance of the Python Calculator is set up for each page which pre-loads a few packages needed to complete the exercise. Make sure you use link that is on the page of the exercises you are working on. 
```

## Links to Interactive Notebooks

Binder and Colab.

These are notebooks. They are like small pieces of IPython statements, called *cells*...
