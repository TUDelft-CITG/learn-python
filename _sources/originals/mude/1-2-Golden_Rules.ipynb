    "## Why do the Golden Rules for Documentation and Communication exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will spend a lot of your study hours in the MUDE module writing, reading and debugging Python code, regardless of your prior programming experience. Your time is valuable, especially once you start working after graduation! Yet it is all too common that most code is never re-used because it is poorly *documented*, making it not understandable to others, or even to yourself at a later moment. In addition, as a young practicing engineer or researcher it is critical that you are able to use your code to effectively *communicate* your results, otherwise the effort put into your analysis is wasted. Good code writing, code documentation and presentation of results such as figures, tables and numbers are all essential for effective collaboration. Even when working individually, it is important to preserve your work such that you can easily understand and re-use in the future. This document will provide and explain a number of reccommendations to help you accomplish that.\n",

    "The following quote summarizes the philosophy of this document concisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: right\"><em>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</em></div>  \n",

    "### A note of encouragement\n",

    "This document contains a lot of information that might not appear to be useful to you...*yet*. Keep in mind that the content here was created in collaboration with many colleagues who are working in industry and will be looking to hire you after you graduate from TU Delft: they will appreciate good coding documentation and communication skills! Our primary advice in MUDE, and for the rest of your MSc program, is that you take a look at this material now, but also keep the Golden Rules in mind and refer back to them often. If you can incorporate them into your work in MUDE, you will have made good habits for yourself that we know will serve you well in the future.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We focused on illustrating good coding practice in a format and language that is approachable to engineers with a varied programming background. As such, specific fundamental programming and computer science concepts are avoided.

    "## Documentation and Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "The words in the title of this lesson were chosen very carefully. *Documentation* refers to all the work related to a problem you are working on. In MUDE, documentation is not limited to describing the purpose and function of your code only. Clearly documented code is important, but in CEG it is also critical to describe all the steps in your analysis, for example: data and data sources, assumptions, results, discussion and recommendations. Jupyter notebooks provide the ideal platform for combining documentation and analysis in one file, which is why we rely on them heavily in MUDE and the focus of this lesson. However, remember there are many other options available to you for proper documentation of your work, and the topics we cover here always apply. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Communication* refers to how you use your code, the analysis you run and the format by which you share it. Rarely are you running a piece of code purely for yourself, but often to share with others---perhaps for a homework assignment, to include in a thesis, a scientific publication, a design at a consultancy, et cetera. Why go through all the trouble of writing and using code if no one can understand what you did with it? It may be clear to you right now, but what if someone wants to use it in the future, or ask about your results, when you are not there? Will the audience understand your work if you have unreadable or overly complex tables and figures in a MSc thesis or conference presentation? Good communication is therefore critical, and there are many aspects, for example: visual formatting (visual appearance of code, text output, figures, tables); transparency and understadability (what did you do? is it repeatable? will someone understand it in the future, perhaps out of context?); and, for code explicitly: readability. This lesson provides a number of useful guidelines that will help your communication improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the title of this document is a bit simplistic. In reality, it should be: *the Golden Rules: a non-exhaustive list of highly recommended habits to build into your life to make sure you can easily and consistently document your work in a way that ensures effective communication with others, as well as your future self.* But that doesnâ€™t roll off the tongue like our current title does. And it doesnâ€™t fit in 79 characters either ðŸ˜‰."

    "## Style Guide for Python (PEP 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals, which is how the Python community describes new features and guidelines related to the development and (reccommended) use of the programming language. Although there are many [PEPs](https://peps.python.org/), the MUDE Golden Rules are in part inspired by one in particular: [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). PEP 8 is important because it directly addresses the readability of Python code and is thus directly aligned with the objectives of our Golden Rules. Unfortunately, PEP 8 can also seem boring, tedious and unimportant to engineers who are learning to use Python. The Golden Rules are created in part to help with this, so for now, we ask that you read carefully the [first](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#introduction) and [second](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#a-foolish-consistency-is-the-hobgoblin-of-little-minds) sections of PEP 8 to help understand the general motivation, then scan through PEP 8 to get an idea of the structure. You may want to use the website [pep8.org](https://pep8.org/), which uses text formatting and is (visually) much easier to read. Don't just open the website; you should devote at least 15 minutes reading the text and example code and consider how this might influence the way you write code. You don't need to read every word, but rather focus on the background, justification and examples for the sections that are most relevant to us:  \n",
    "- Code lay-out: indentation, line length, line breaks, blank lines\n",
    "- Whitespace\n",
    "- Comments\n",
    "- Naming conventions  \n",
    "\n",
    "After around 15 minutes of reading, you should have a good idea of the general philosophy and specific ways to change the way you write Python code. Many of these guidelines are incorporated into the Golden Rules, but sometimes PEP 8 will provide more detail or background, and most importantly: example code. Therefore, you should bookmark the website and refer back to it often.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that checking some of the PEP 8 guidelines could be quite tedious, like counting 4 spaces on indentation or checking to make sure there are no spaces at the end of a line. This is just the type of thing that computers are good at! Fortunately there are a number of tools available to autocheck (and even autocorrect) Python code based on some (but not all!) of the reccommendations in PEP 8. The elements of PEP 8 that are most relevant to us are summarized here: \n",
    "- Indentation\n",
    "- Whitespace and blank lines\n",
    "- Line length and line break location\n",
    "- Import statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Compliance with PEP 8 is carried out by the package [`pycodestyle`](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/), and you can see a detailed list of what is being checked in your code by looking at the the [list of error codes](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/intro.html#error-codes). There are a few other PEP 8 guidelines that are not included in the list above or in our Golden Rules (specifically, issues in the statement and runtime groups in `pycodestyle`). If these come up as warnings or errors when reviewing your code with an autochecker you can read more about what the problem is in the PEP 8 documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section covers PEP 8 autocheckers, but you should **always remember: only a subset the PEP 8 guidelines can be evaluated by automatic PEP 8 checkers and fixers.** For example, a computer cannot tell you whether or not your variable name is descriptive enough, or consider what variable name length is appropriate for the specific piece of code you are writing---this is something that you must determine on your own or with your team that may be hard at first, but becomes easier with a bit of practice. To convey this perspective, we adapt the quote by Martin Fowler given above:\n",

    "### Checking PEP 8 automatically with `autopep8`\n",
    "\n",
    "Although PEP 8 may look quite complicated and tedious at first glance, automatic PEP 8 formatters exist. The one we recommend you to use is `autopep8`, which can be applied on both `.py` files and `.ipynb` jupyter notebooks. A full explanation about the capabilities of this tool can be found at the [Python Package Index page](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Bonus tip: the Python Package Index, PyPI, is the official website for Python software, where most publicly available packages can be found, and is the default source when you install packages using `pip`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installation (Optional, but reccommended)\n",
    "In order to install `autopep8`, you can simply run the following `pip` command in your terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install autopep8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the following command to auto-format python files and jupyter notebooks in-place. After the command execution has finished, your files will have been autoformatted. Make sure you replace `<filename>` with the name and extension of the file you wish to auto-format.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "autopep8 --in-place <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "`autopep8` can be added as an extension to JupyterHub, which allows you to interact with the tool through a Jupyter Notebook rather than the terminal. This can be achieved with the help of a `Jupyter Nbextensions Configurator`, which you may need to install first, before setting up `autopep8` as an extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the IDEs such as Spyder and PyCharm contain add-ons that can be installed to automate the PEP 8 checks. Rather than providing a long list of installation instructions here, we'd encourage you to already get started with Rule X: using Google and Stack Overflow to help you identify and install a PEP 8 tool that will work for you. If you are using the JupyterHub, you can always copy and paste text into [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/), as done in the first example above."

    "## Rule 1: Use descriptive names\n",
    "\n",
    "*My colleague/student constantly shares code with me but the variables are acronyms and are overwritten, which makes it difficult to read and use.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*X1, X2, X3... oh, again X1 (overwrite). Was the previous X1 important?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Often when you work, you will be sharing your code with other people and you need make sure that they understand what each variable is doing and how it relates to the other variables. However, this may difficult or even impossible when the variable names do not represent the purpose they have.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, variable names such as `a`, `a1`, `x`, `plot`, `plot1` may not be descriptive enough to use in your code. Additionally, `kruidnoten` may not be a good variable name for a weather time series plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming up with descriptive names requires practice, but when in doubt don't be afraid to use longer names to be specific. It's easy to change names in a script later with find and replace. The only downside if your names are too long is that you have to add a few more line breaks (we give you a few tips for this in ***Golden Role***), however, the downside of names that are too short is that you or a colleague has to spend hours in the future interpreting, or even rewriting your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some names to avoid. Namely, never use the characters `l` (lowercase letter el), `O` (uppercase letter oh), or `I` (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names. In some fonts, these characters are indistinguishable from the numerals one and zero. When tempted to use `l`, use `L` instead. Better yet: consider a variable name that is longer than one character.\n",

    "## Rule 2: Make readable code\n",
    "\n",
    "*I hate it when a piece of code is passed to me that I cannot understand on itself.*\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule pretty much speaks for itself, and is also the Golden Rule most closely linked to PEP 8. So rather than rewrite it, we reccommend that at the start you focus on the four aspects of PEP 8 listed here. And don't forget to read the document every once in a while to refresh your memory and see examples.  \n",
    "- blank lines are great for making space, but don't overuse them\n",
    "- use indentation to make your line breaks readable\n",
    "- space around operators, especially =, +, -, and after function arguments\n",
    "- incorporate a maximum line length\n",
    "\n",
    "The 79 character maximum line length reccommendation in PEP 8 is often a contentious one. It's important to limit line length because not all documentation software, word processers, text viewers, etc, know how to present long lines of code. Line breaks may introduced in a way that makes the code completely unreadable, or worse, large portions of your code may not be visible when printed. However, you will find that in practice it is very difficult to limit your lines to 79 characters, especially if you are using descriptive variable and function names (Golden Rule 1). On the other hand, once you learn a few tricks for making easy line breaks (below), it becomes much easier. So, our advice is to *definitely* incorporate a maximum line length in your code, but start with 79 and feel free to increase it doesn't work for a certain project. It's generally not a problem to increase the maximum length to 100 or even 120 characters, and autoformatters can be set up to help enforce this. Whatever you do, just make sure that your lines don't get cut off or broken in a way that makes your code unreadable. To help, we provide a few tips for adding line breaks to your code. Can you find the PEP 8 violations in this example? Try copying this code into [pep8online.com](http://pep8online.com/) to test yourself.\n"

    "\n",
    "There are courses and books devoted to this Golden Rule, not to mention professional editors and typesetters. While you should aways make sure your results are readable, there are three main categories where it is easy to make significant improvements to readability and communication: figures, tables and numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You've gone through all the work to write code, run analyses, collect results and present them in figures. Why not spend a little extra effort to make the figure easy for your reader or audience to interpret? You should always make sure a figure contains enough information for a viewer to understand the main variables even if taken out of context, which can be done easily by including axis labels and a title, both with units, as well as a legend. Use of high contrast colors, symbols and line types is important if a lot of curves or data types are included. Finally, depending on the importance and use consider: setting good axis limits and increments (e.g., tics every 5 instead of 7), equal scale axes, grid lines, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our advice is to get in the habit of always adding a few simple commands to format to make it easy to repeat when it matters. Rather than take up space here with examples, keep an eye out for nicely formatted figures in MUDE notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to figures, make sure key information about the contents such as variable name, type and units are included. Limiting the number of significant figures to 3, adding more only when needed, can significantly improve the readability of a table. There are a number of tools available for creating tables, so we encourage you to use Google to find a few that work for your working method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significant digits  \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you know that computers can store decimals up to 16 digits? If you let it, Python will try to return as many of these digits as possible. When you present results of your calculation with 6 or 8 decimal values, you give a false (and at times silly) impression of precision. For example, is that wind speed *really* 14.4613587 m/s? Especially when the accuracy of the sensor is +/-10% and the wind is gusting significantly? For most engineering purposes, 3 significant digits is plenty and can be considered a default. You can always add more if you have a good reason to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately Python has a great tool to help you use an appropriate number of significant digits: `f-strings`. A few quick examples are provided below, and you can [read more about f-strings here](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/), or any of the other good resources online."

    "This illustrates the concept of **modularity**: using functions to decompose the code into smaller pieces that minimize repetition and the chance of including errors. **Modules** and modular code are important general programming concepts, but also have particular significance for the Python language. This topic will be explained in a later workshop, so for now we encourage you to use functions and modularise your code. Simply taking a few moments to think about: 1) which part(s) of your analysis can be defined in a function, 2) write the functions at the top of your notebook or script (after importing your packages), then using them below, hence the name of this rule: **write simple functions, then use them.** It looks like this:\n",
