# Original Material

This page summarizes the material from which the new online book/course will be made.

[Mark Bakker's course](http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/) is also a source of reference material (and our online course).

[This](https://moorepants.github.io/learn-multibody-dynamics/install.html) may be a good place to look for a how-to install guide.


## Python Basics for MUDE

```{note}
This section is taken mostly verbatim from the MUDE Brightspace page where the 8 Vocareum notebooks were provided. Some instructions/overview will be useful for redesigning the online course.
```

See the page Software installation and tools (on the Week 1.1 Landing Zone page) for Python information for MUDE. (NB: *included as a seppage in this book*)

This page contains Python worksheets that were made available as an online Summer course for those that are new to Python or may need a refresher. They are available in Vocareum, which is a tool for checking your work and giving feedback automatically in a Jupyter notebook. See the PDF for instructions how to use Vocareum.

You can do the notebooks independently (so if you know the basics, but would like to train your numpy skills, you can go directly that the 5th notebook).

Advice: if you are really new to Python, do the first 2 notebooks. Use the others are reference. And then continue with the Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib notebooks that were provided in the first workshop of MUDE.
